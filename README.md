# Neural_Network
These files will be the beginning of a personal attempt to create a convolutional neural network (CNN).
The two classes that make the base neural net are tightly coupled such that they act as a single unit, only separated.
In short, the Node class provides the building blocks to build the Neural (Green currently) class which will allow users to create multiple feed-forward multilayered artificial neural networks with backpropagation. From there a linker class will join these such that we have another neural net object where each node is itself a neural net.
